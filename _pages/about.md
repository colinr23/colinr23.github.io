I am an interdisciplinary applied scientist and geographer. I am broadly trained in geographic information science and spatial analysis, with application foci in environmental health applications. This covers a broad swath of issues and problems where  environmental change shapes the conditions for healthy ecosystems, populations, and people. I see the use of integrative spatial tools as a [bridge](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/a301683) to bring science communities together to work on real-world problems of social significance. 

I am currently an Associate Professor in the [Department of Geography](https://students.wlu.ca/programs/science/geography-and-environmental-studies/index.html?ref=ges) at [Wilfrid Laurier University](https://wlu.ca/), and the Director of the [Cold Regions Research Centre](https://coldregions.ca/). I am also am affiliate researcher with the [Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative](http://www.cwhc-rcsf.ca/). I have collaborated with all levels of government, industry, non-profits, and several communities as well as other researchers in the course of my career. I strive to make an impact on management and well-being of the communities, ecosystems, and regions where I work, in addition to scholarly contributions.

I have developed this website as an overview of my research and teaching career, aiming to highlight skills, partnerships, applied problems, and my approach to applied science.

Wilfrid Laurier University is located on the [Haldimand tract](https://native-land.ca/maps/treaties/haldimand-treaty/), traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishnaabe (Anish-nah-bay) and Haudenosaunee (Hoe-den-no-show-nee) peoples.
