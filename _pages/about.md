I am a spatial data scientist and applied researcher specializing in geographic information science and environmental analytics. My expertise bridges advanced spatial analysis with modern machine learning and AI applications, particularly in environmental health and maritime domains. Throughout my career, I've focused on solving complex problems where environmental change impacts ecosystem and human health, developing novel spatial analytical approaches to extract meaningful insights from geospatial data.

Currently, I lead data science initiatives at Boeing Vancouver, focusing on advanced analytics for aerospace applications. Previously, as Director of Data Science at GSTS, I led a team developing and deploying AI/ML solutions for maritime intelligence, combining traditional spatial analysis with modern deep learning approaches. Until 2023, I served as an Associate Professor in the Department of Geography and Environmental Studies at Wilfrid Laurier University and Director of the Cold Regions Research Centre, where I founded the Spatial Lab to advance geospatial research and applications.

My collaborative approach has fostered successful partnerships across government, industry, non-profits, and communities. These partnerships have resulted in practical solutions to critical environmental challenges, from climate change monitoring through citizen science (RinkWatch) to advanced spatial surveillance methods for environmental health. I specialize in translating complex spatial analysis into actionable insights that bridge the gap between academic research and practical applications.

This website showcases my research, teaching career, and ongoing work in spatial data science. Here you'll find examples of applied projects, technical solutions, and collaborative approaches to solving real-world problems through innovative spatial analytics.
