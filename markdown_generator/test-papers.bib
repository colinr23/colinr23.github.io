	abstract = {Disease surveillance makes use of information technology at almost every stage of the process, from data collection and collation, through to analysis and dissemination. Automated data collection systems enable near-real time analysis of incoming data. This context places a heavy burden on software used for space-time surveillance. In this paper, we review software programs capable of space-time disease surveillance analysis, and outline some of their salient features, shortcomings, and usability. Programs with space-time methods were selected for inclusion, limiting our review to {ClusterSeer}, {SaTScan}, {GeoSurveillance} and the Surveillance package for R. We structure the review around stages of analysis: preprocessing, analysis, technical issues, and output. Simulated data were used to review each of the software packages. {SaTScan} was found to be the best equipped package for use in an automated surveillance system. {ClusterSeer} is more suited to data exploration, and learning about the different methods of statistical surveillance.},

	abstract = {Japanese Encephalitis ({JE}) is a vector-borne disease of major importance in Asia. Recent increases in cases have spawned the development of more stringent {JE} surveillance. Due to the difficulty of making a clinical diagnosis, increased tracking of common symptoms associated with {JE}—generally classified as the umbrella term, acute encephalitis syndrome ({AES}) has been developed in many countries. In Nepal, there is some debate as to what {AES} cases are, and how {JE} risk factors relate to {AES} risk. Three parts of this analysis included investigating the temporal pattern of cases, examining the age and vaccination status patterns among {AES} surveillance data, and then focusing on spatial patterns of risk factors. {AES} and {JE} cases from 2007–2011 reported at a district level (n = 75) were examined in relation to landscape risk factors. Landscape pattern indices were used to quantify landscape patterns associated with {JE} risk. The relative spatial distribution of landscape risk factors were compared using geographically weighted regression. Pattern indices describing the amount of irrigated land edge density and the degree of landscape mixing for irrigated areas were positively associated with {JE} and {AES}, while fragmented forest measured by the number of forest patches were negatively associated with {AES} and {JE}. For both {JE} and {AES}, the local {GWR} models outperformed global models, indicating spatial heterogeneity in risks. Temporally, the patterns of {JE} and {AES} risk were almost identical; suggesting the relative higher caseload of {AES} compared to {JE} could provide a valuable early-warning signal for {JE} surveillance and reduce diagnostic testing costs. Overall, the landscape variables associated with a high degree of landscape mixing and small scale irrigated agriculture were positively linked to {JE} and {AES} risk, highlighting the importance of integrating land management policies, disease prevention strategies and promoting healthy sustainable livelihoods in both rural and urban-fringe developing areas.},

	abstract = {{SUMMARYLeptospirosis} is one of the most widespread zoonoses in the world. A large outbreak of suspected human leptospirosis began in Sri Lanka during 2008. This study investigated spatial variables associated with suspected leptospirosis risk during endemic and outbreak periods. Data were obtained for monthly numbers of reported cases of suspected clinical leptospirosis for 2005-2009 for all of Sri Lanka. Space-time scan statistics were combined with regression modelling to test associations during endemic and outbreak periods. The cross-correlation function was used to test association between rainfall and leptospirosis at four locations. During the endemic period (2005-2007), leptospirosis risk was positively associated with shorter average distance to rivers and with higher percentage of agriculture made up of farms {\textless}0·20 hectares. Temporal correlation analysis of suspected leptospirosis cases and rainfall revealed a 2-month lag in rainfall-case association during the baseline period. Outbreak locations in 2008 were characterized by shorter distance to rivers and higher population density. The analysis suggests the possibility of household transmission in densely populated semi-urban villages as a defining characteristic of the outbreak. The role of rainfall in the outbreak remains to be investigated, although analysis here suggests a more complex relationship than simple correlation.},

	abstract = {User-generated content ({UGC}) that contains spatial references, often referred to by the more bounded concept of Volunteered Geographic Information ({VGI}), is often touted as a potentially revolutionary data source for geographical research. This paper explores the capacity of one increasingly prevalent source of these data, geographically encoded photographs, to capture spatial expressions of place in an urban environment. Geotagged photographs were obtained from the Flickr {API} to build a geographic database of photographs for the city of Vancouver, Canada from 2001–2012. These data were aggregated to multiple geographic units represented as hexagonal lattices. Spatial patterns of photo aggregation were examined for tessellations that ranged from 0.25 ha to 1024 ha. Tags associated with each photo were also explored through the notion of ‘tag-space’ at multiple resolutions, or “scales”, of analysis through local log-odds ratios. Results indicate a significant interaction between tag-space semantics and spatial aggregation which suggests that consideration of scale effects should be integral to analysis of this type of tagged {VGI} for exploring citizens’ sensing of urban environments. The results indicate further that we may have to reconsider the interaction between encoded meaning, the methods used for extracting such meaning from tag-space, and exogenous and endogenous spatial scales of spatial {UGC}.},
