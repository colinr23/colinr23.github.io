This course offers an introduction to the basic principles and techniques of earth observation sensors and imagery. Digital image processing methods are widely used in mapping and monitoring environmental change and geographers in many fields use remotely sensed imagery as a data source in their research. 

This course will provide an understanding of the theory underlying satellite remote sensing of the earth, energy interactions in the atmosphere and the surface, and digital image processing techniques. Hands-on experience in the lab component will allow students to develop skills in remote sensing software PCI Geomatica. Integration of remotely sensed imagery with GIS software and GIS-based analysis will be emphasized throughout the course

**Course Goal and Learning Outcomes**

The goal of this course is to develop an understanding of basic principles, theories, and methods needed to use remotely sensed imagery in geographical and environmental applications. In completing this course, students will be able to:

1.	Understand how electromagnetic energy interacts with the atmosphere and surface   
2.	Use spectral signatures to interpret landcover characteristics  
3.	Perform preprocessing of remotely sensed imagery
4.	Describe and interpret properties of remotely sensed imagery
