[This project](https://rpubs.com/colinr23/bctracker) extracted data from a citizen-based project recording school exposure notifications in British Columbia. The data were mapped in Leaflet and run through Space-Time Scan Statistics cluster detection to identify emergent patterns of COVID-19 school exposures during the Third Wave of COVID-19 in British Columbia in Spring of 2021.
