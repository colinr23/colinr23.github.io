I am an interdisciplinary applied scientist. I am trained in geographic information science and spatial data science, with significant experience in environmental health applications. My research experience covers a broad swath of issues and problems where  environmental change shapes the conditions for healthy ecosystems, populations, and people. I have been focusing more recenly on how machine learning and AI can be deployed in these types of geospatial problems. 

I am currently Director of Data Science where I lead a team of data scientists on developing and deploying geospatial AI and ML applications in the maritime sector. Until 2023 I was an Associate Professor in the [Department of Geography and Environmental Studies](https://students.wlu.ca/programs/science/geography-and-environmental-studies/index.html?ref=ges) at [Wilfrid Laurier University](https://wlu.ca/), and previously the Director of the [Cold Regions Research Centre](https://coldregions.ca/). My lab group publications and team members are at the [Spatial Lab](https://thespatiallab.org/) website. 

I have collaborated with all levels of government, industry, non-profits, and several communities as well as other researchers in the course of my career. I strive to make an impact in the world by tackling critical environmental problems through collaborative development of practical insights and technical solutions.

I have developed this website as an overview of my research and teaching career, aiming to highlight skills, partnerships, applied problems, and my approach to applied science.
