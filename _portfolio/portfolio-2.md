This multi-year project developed a new approach to geospatial data representation, storage, and analysis. We combined an analytics data warehouse with a discrete global grid geospatial data model to create a [new analytics system for large-scale environmental data analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271620300502). Several demonstration analyses and case studies have been deployed on the system including a [flood risk mapping app](https://spatial.wlu.ca/inundated/) and [related paper](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/3295/2021/), and a [wildfire simulation study](https://agile-giss.copernicus.org/articles/1/6/2020/).
